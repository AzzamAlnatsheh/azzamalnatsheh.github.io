![](/assets/img/BRS.png)
Reduced manual tracking effort by **40%** and provided real-time insight to **Procurement, Accounts Payable & Treasury departments** through developing a dynamic, frequently refreshed report covering the entire P2P cycle (**Purchase Request (PR) → Purchase Order (PO) → Goods Received Note (GRN) → Invoice → Bank Reconcilation Statement (BRS)**). 

### <ins>SQL Source Migration and Refresh Enhancement</ins>
![](/assets/img/SQL.png)
Engineered a linked server integration between **SAP HANA** and **Microsoft SQL Server** to enable incremental sales data loading. Improved ETL efficiency by **60%**, ensuring faster data availability for reporting and decision-making.

This query is for extracting SALES_DATA from a linked server in SQL Server Management Studio to a SQL Server:
```
SELECT *
FROM OPENQUERY(LINKED_SERVER_NAME,
  'SELECT * FROM SERVER.SCHEMA.SALES_DATA')
```

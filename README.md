## Projects
### Migration of SAC Financial Dashboard → Microsoft Power BI
![SAC → PBI](/assets/img/SAC → PBI.png)
Migrated **9 financial dashboards from SAC to Power BI** including which enhanced financial reporting by **30%**: 
- [Accounts Payable (AP)](/assets/pbi/Accounts Payable.pbix)
    ![AP](/assets/img/AP.png)
- [Accounts Receivable (AR)](/assets/pbi/Accounts Receivable.pbix)
    ![AR](/assets/img/AR.png)
- [Balance Sheet](/assets/pbi/Balance Sheet.pbix)

### Automated Report for Supplier Tracking in Power BI
Developed a dynamic, frequently refreshed report covering the entire P2P cycle (**PR → PO → GRN → Invoice → BRS**). Reduced manual tracking effort by **40%** and provided real-time insights to **Procurement, AP & Treasury teams.**

### SQL Source Migration and Refresh Enhancement
Engineered a linked server integration between **SAP HANA** and **Microsoft SQL Server** to enable incremental sales data loading. Improved ETL efficiency by **60%**, ensuring faster data availability for reporting and decision-making.

```
SELECT *
FROM OPENQUERY(LINKED_SERVER_NAME,
  'SELECT * FROM SERVER.SCHEMA.SALES_DATA')
```

### Finance Workspace App in Power BI
Designed and deployed a **Finance Workspace App** integrating **15+** financial dashboards into a centralized access point this enabled the financial department to use the built reports and dashboards using only one link.

### Arabic News Clustering for Factuality Estimation​
[Project Poster](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AjP1Qj8WbN9GlxwLn-3bxiGwylyj?e=0cab5u)

Created a NLP project that checks the worthiness of Arabic news and tweets using the Checkworthiness dataset found in GitLab. The dataset is labelled and our task was to find the most suitable model to classify if the text is worth checking or not. The suitable model is then deployed into an interface where the user can have the option of testing the model and check the Checkworthiness meter that is found next to the textbox where the user can insert their news for checking.

### CO2 Emissions Visualizations through PowerBI
[Dashboard Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SFvz2RMeI2BsqXjN9BdY4GLgEJ9iswwl/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107487010576341814592&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Built a dashboard that shows the rate of how much CO2 is being omitted in each country along with each region. Used **PowerBI** to create this interactive dashboard where you can view the map of countries and regions that have the highest CO2 Emissions. In the presentation we give reasoning of why are CO2 Emissions have increased in certain regions and how critical it is to reduce the emissions to be able to reduce Global Warming that affects many wild life where people are unaware about.

### Cyber Bullying Arabic Tweets Detector
[Source Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iMMVWkHd0Cd_XZqDOFMt8oH2qYvhIy4m?usp=sharing)

Used **Python** to create an NLP model that detects a safe tweet from a toxic tweet in the Arabic language. The most suitable model for this project was AraBERT which is a transformer that is pre-trained on many Arabic datasets that can then be fine-tuned to our liking. At first we focused on scarping the Arabic tweets that are related to the Qatar World Cup 2022 which was trending at that time, after getting the dataset we labelled them and used AraBERT to test if it can classify the tweets accordingly. At the end we created an interface through StreamLit where we can allow the user to test our model.
